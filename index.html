                    <p> Welcome to my beta portfolio, 
                        Please excuse the lack of content as I am still a work in progress...
                        I professionally come from a culinary background, as time went on I was always looking for new challenges.
                        After spending about 10 years in logistics for various industries it has opened my interest in the technology world.
                        From that point on my sudden interest has pivoted into learning the basics and fundamentals of writing code. I enjoy the creativity
                        it can bring out and hope to later utiilize this complex digital language as a skillset.
                    </p>

                        my team would like to add later down the road.
